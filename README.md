How to play Flow Free  

The objective in the game Flow Free,  is to connect each dot of the same color in a continuous line. The path of the line can not cross or overlap to a color dot/path that is not the same color. Finally before the level is complete, you cant leave a single piece of the grid uncovered.  Once you start working your way though the game, each level will gradually become unlocked. I found it extremely useful to work each level in order. As the levels increase, each level pack will becoming bigger. This will increase the grid size and also add additional dots.
